driftMaps.com integrates all the adventures of world exploration into an expressive cartographic experience.

How does it work?
driftMaps.com is organized into Journeys and Way Points. For example a trek across South America, will have many stops along the way in cities, towns or parks.
What kind of stuff will a Way Point include?

Way Point content creation is organized into 3 categories: Photos, Friends and Journals.
